# RSSCHOOL-CV

**'RSSchool-CV'** is a task I've done on the Rolling Scopes School frontend course.
This is a basic task to get acquainted with git and Github. The main goal is to code a CV page using basic HTML and CSS.

You can see the full task description [here](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/js-fe-course-en/blob/main/tasks/CV(markdown)/CV(HTML+CSS+Markdown).md) and [here if you prefer russian version](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/cv/cv.md).

## Design

Design inspired by Github and simple CV layout was imagined and implemented by me.
